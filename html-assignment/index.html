            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Kayla and I'm 20 years old. I'm from Lindsay, a small town located about an hour north-east of the GTA. I moved to Ottawa in 2021 after enrolling in the Computer Science program at Carleton University. After struggling to keep up in that program, I decided to switch to the Media Production and Design program. While I liked it a lot better than Computer Science, I began to realize that university wasn't really for me. That's how I ended up enrolling in the Interactive Media Design program at Algonquin College!</p>
            <p>A fun fact about me is that I have a black cat named Astrid (I named her after the girl from <i>How To Train Your Dragon</i>---coincidentally, their personalities are <em>very</em> similar). She's the best, although I wouldn't trust her around your bird!</p>
